### Natural Language Processing for Fuzzy String Matching with Python

In computer science, fuzzy string matching is the technique of finding strings that match a pattern approximately (rather than exactly). In another word, fuzzy string matching is a type of search that will find matches even when users misspell words or enter only partial words for the search. It is also known as approximate string matching.

Fuzzy string search can be used in various applications, such as:

* A spell checker and spelling-error, typos corrector. For example, a user types “Missisaga” into Google, a list of hits is returned along with “Showing results for mississauga”. That is, search query returns results even if the user input contains additional or missing characters, or other types of spelling error.
* A software can be used to check for duplicate records. For example, if a customer is listed multiple times with different purchases in the database due to different spellings of their name (i.e. Abigail Martin vs. Abigail Martinez) a new address, or a mistakenly-entered phone number.
