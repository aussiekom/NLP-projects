### Natural Language Processing Projects

These projects serve as practical demonstrations of various NLP techniques and methodologies. 

* **The NLP-Python** contains Python-based projects showcasing techniques such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), text classification and some matching strings techniques using libraries like NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, fuzzywuzzy, and pymatch.
* **The NLP-R** focuses on similar tasks, but implemented in the R programming language, leveraging packages like tm, quanteda, and caret.
* **Hugging Face Transformers** is an introduction to the Hugging Face Transformers Python library. Hugging Face provides access to models (both the code that implements them and their pre-trained weights), model-specific tokenizers, as well as pipelines for common NLP tasks, and datasets and metrics in a separate datasets package.
